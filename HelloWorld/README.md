# HelloWorld Sample
The HelloWorld sample provides a simple COBOL program and Groovy build script created to show the simpliest form of using DBB to build z/OS programs.  In order to keep the build script as simple as possible, hard coded values are used and need to be changed in order for the script to run on your system.
